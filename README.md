## Problem
### Lack of Motivation to Stay Healthy: 
Many people struggle to stay motivated to maintain a consistent running or exercise routine, often due to lack of accountability or tangible incentives.

### Unstructured Competition Among Friends:
While friendly competition can drive motivation, there isnâ€™t an easy way for friends to track and challenge each other effectively, especially for fitness-related goals.

## Need for Accountability:
Without stakes, it's easy to skip runs or fail to commit to fitness goals.
