## 🧐 The Problem

**Staying consistent is hard.**
- Many people struggle to maintain a daily exercise routine due to a lack of accountability.
- Complexity is the enemy of execution. Most fitness apps are too bloated.
- "Gamification" often feels cheap or distracting.

**Spriiint** aims to solve this by doing **one thing well**: tracking your daily push-up progression with zero friction.

## ✨ Features

- **Daily Progression**: Automatically calculates your daily target based on previous performance.
- **Zero Friction Interface**: confirm your workout with a single, satisfying swipe.
- **Apple Health Integration**: (In Progress) Seamlessly syncs workouts to close your rings.
- **Offline First**: Built with local SQLite storage, so it works anywhere.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
